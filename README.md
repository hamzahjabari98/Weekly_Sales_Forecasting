# Weekly Sales Forecasting

This project focuses on weekly sales forecasting and includes two Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, along with a Streamlit app for interactive forecasting using different models.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

### Notebooks

1. **Notebook1.ipynb**
   - This notebook contains all the data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering steps.
   - Model selection and evaluation are also performed in this notebook.
   - It serves as the foundation for building predictive models.

2. **Notebook2.ipynb**
   - This notebook is dedicated to loading and testing the predictive models developed in Notebook1.
   - Model performance metrics, visualizations, and insights are provided here.

### Product.py

- `Product.py` is a Streamlit application that provides an interactive interface for performing weekly, monthly, and yearly sales forecasting using different models.
- Users can explore and visualize forecasts based on their preferences and input parameters.
- The app leverages the models trained in `Notebook1` and tested in `Notebook2` to provide real-time forecasting results.
